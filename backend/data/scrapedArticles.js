Yoga has become a very popular form of physical and mental exercise, and is said to have many meditative and therapeutic benefits. But is yoga safe for people with glaucoma? Certain headstand positions, like the “downward facing dog” pose, are associated with an increase in intraocular fluid pressure (IOP). That could be a problem for people with glaucoma, especially if these types of positions are held for long periods. This doesn’t mean that people with glaucoma can’t do yoga, but a better understanding of how IOP is affected by headstand positions will allow glaucoma patients to avoid certain poses and adjust their routines for a safe and healthy experience. The Risk of Headstand Positions A study from Mt. Sinai Health Systems compares eye pressure in people with no eye-related disease and glaucoma patients as they perform a series of inverted yoga positions, to measure the increase in IOP and how long the increased pressure lasts. They covered the following positions: Downward facing dog (adho mukha svanasana) Standing forward bend (uttanasana) Plow (halasana) Legs up the wall (viparita karani) The researchers captured the IOP in each group at baseline seated, immediately assuming the pose, and two minutes while holding the pose. All four poses raised IOP in both the control group and the glaucoma patients, with the greatest increases associated with downward facing dog. Once the subjects returned to a seated position, they were tested immediately and 10 minutes later. The IOP returned to baseline levels at these time points. The study didn’t show a dramatic difference in IOP between the control group and those participants with glaucoma, however the increase in IOP among glaucoma patients is more impactful to their future vision. “As we know that any elevated IOP is the most important known risk factor for development and progression of nerve damage to the eye, the rise in IOP after assuming the yoga poses is of concern for glaucoma patients and their treating physicians,” said study author Jessica Jaisen, M.En. “In addition, glaucoma patients should share with their yoga instructors their disease to allow for modifications during the practice of yoga.” How Should I Modify My Yoga Routine? Because of these findings and as a precautionary measure while more research is being done, it is probably best for yoga enthusiasts with glaucoma to",

It may surprise you, but the answer is yes. At least 32 million women in the U.S. have high blood pressure or hypertension. Lots of factors contribute to high blood pressure — diet, weight, lifestyle choices and stress, among others. And that’s where yoga comes in. Yoga can reduce stress, and when stress is subtracted from the hypertension equation, blood pressure goes down. Still, when it comes to high blood pressure (HBP) some styles and postures should be avoided or modified. With the information below, you can safely let the practice of yoga work for you to reduce tension, stress and, yes, blood pressure too. What yoga should you avoid with high blood pressure? If you have hypertension, you want to build a yoga practice that has positive effects on your blood pressure. Classes that are heated, extremely rigorous or focus on cardiovascular conditioning raise internal temperature, heart rate and blood pressure.Instead of pushing yourself, opt for slower paced vinyasa, hatha, restorative oryin-style yoga classes. Daily meditation can also lead to stress reduction and blood pressure modulation. Breathwork (Pranayama) that creates a lot of heat (like Breath of Fire)or has you hold your breath is also not advised. You want your breathing to always be smooth, steady and evenly paced. The moment it gets heavy or choppy, stop what you are doing and rest until you have reset your rhythm. The following poses should be avoided or modified. You’ll find helpful modifications in the next section. Difficult arm balances. Arm balances can be fun and challenging but, if you’re pushed to overexertion, frustration or strain, skip these poses. Inversions are risky if you have HBP. When your head is below your heart, blood rushes in and causes extra pressure on the brain, blood vessels and heart. This can increase the risk of stroke so avoid inversions such as Headstand, Shoulder Stand, Forearm Stand, and Handstand. Legs-Up-The-Wall (Viparita Karani) is debatable. One camp advises against it because your legs are inverted at a 90° angle up from the heart. The other camp says it’s okay because your head and heart are in the same line. Additionally, the pose is inherently relaxing, restorative and reduces stress. Just give it a miss if you have any doubts if it’s right for you or",

Poses to avoid Poses to try Benefits Considerations For beginners Bottom line Practicing yoga during the first trimester allows you to carve out valuable time for yourself that you can use to get in touch with your body and emotions. You may also end up exploring the more subtle aspects of yoga relating to topics such as the chakras, meditation, or yoga nidra. A solid yoga routine can provide physical and mental benefits that may help you navigate your pregnancy and the road beyond. There are prenatal yoga guidelines specific to each trimester. This article will guide you through yoga poses to practice and avoid during the first trimester. You’ll also learn more about the benefits of prenatal yoga and tips for practicing safely. Share on Pinterest Malquerida Studio/Stocksy United Is first trimester yoga safe? It’s safe to practice yoga during the first trimester as long as you follow the safety precautions, modify as needed, and stay away from certain poses altogether. While it’s usually OK to do most yoga poses, called asanas in Sanskrit, cultivating a less-is-more attitude is preferable to pushing yourself beyond your limits. What poses should you avoid in first trimester yoga? For the most part, you can likely keep up with your usual yoga practice or fitness routine in the first trimester . However, you may need to adjust your practice slightly and make modifications. For example, when doing twists, choose open twists that don’t compress your belly, and twist at the level of your shoulders or upper back instead of from the base of your spine. Instead of allowing your head to drop down during forward bends, hold your head up with your hands or props such as cushions or blocks. During the first trimester, avoid: intense backbends , twists, and forward bends poses that involve forceful contractions or engagement of your abdominals poses that put lots of pressure on your belly inversions (unless you are highly experienced or are working closely with a qualified yoga instructor) Poses to support the first trimester of pregnancy During the first trimester, do y",

These organs are confined and protected by the muscles in the abdomen. A hernia occurs when these muscles are so weakened that a gap is made in the abdominal wall and part of an internal organ bulges out. A hernia can either be congenital or be caused by surgery or lack of exercise. Such weakness can either be congenital or be caused by surgery or lack of exercise. Post-surgery suture lines are vulnerable sites, while insufficient exercise weakens your muscles and burdens your abdomen with excess fat. Straining these weakened muscles by lifting heavy weights or even through chronic coughing or constipation can create a gap and result in a hernia. Yoga postures cannot cure this—once a gap has been made, hernia-repair surgery is necessary to close it. Yoga can help you avoid a recurrence, however, by strengthening your abdominal muscles, reducing fat, and promoting body awareness. It can also help to prevent a hernia from occurring in the first place. Start yoga asana gradually, under the supervision of your doctor or a yoga specialist You must wait at least two weeks before starting yoga if you have undergone hernia-repair surgery, longer if you have had other major surgery. Then start yoga asana gradually, under the supervision of your doctor or a yoga specialist. During your recovery period avoid double-leg raises, forward and backward bending, sideways bending, twisting, the sun salute, prone asanas, and the camel. Whether you are recovering from surgery or simply wish to strengthen your abdominal wall, adding the following exercises to your basic hatha yoga routine will be helpful. Single-Leg Raising Lie down, with your arms by your sides. As you inhale, slowly raise your left leg up, without bending your knee, as far as you can without feeling pain in your hamstrings, then exhale as you lower it. Keep your lower back close to the floor. Start with 5 leg raises for each leg and work up to 20. If you are recovering from hernia-repair surgery, practice single-leg raising three times a day, but only raise your legs up to 60.˚ Avoid any strain to your abdomen. Head Lifting Lie down, with your legs out straight and your arms by your sides. Exhale and raise your head, shoulders, and arms. Hold for a moment, and then come down on the inhalation and relax. Repeat up to 20 times. Avoid this exercise if you feel pain in your abdomen or neck; or only come up partway at first, and work up to the full position gradually. Embryo Lie with your heels together, arms stretched out behind you. Bend your knees as you raise your legs, and inhale slowly. Then, as you exhale, tuck your knees in to your chest, holding them with interlocked fingers, and bring your chin up to your knees. Next, extend your left leg at 45˚ and rotate it in the air, 5 times clockwise and 5 times counterclockwise, breathing normally. Repeat with your right leg. Finally, bring both legs to your chest and rock back and forth a few times. Half Shoulderstand Lie on your back and raise your legs as you inhale, bending your knees if necessary. Exhaling, bring your legs farther back so your hips come off the floor. Support your hips with yours hands, resting your weight on your arms, shoulders, and elbows. Inhaling, lift your legs up to the vertical position, but let your trunk remain at an angle of 45.˚ If the strain on your hands is too great, lower your legs toward your head. Hold, breathing normally; then bend your legs, release your arms, and roll out of the pose as you exhale. Sectional Breathing Inhale by letting your abdomen bulge and then exhale by drawing it in continuously and slowly. While learning, place one of your hands on your abdomen. Keep your chest and shoulders stationary. Next, hold your shoulders and abdomen still as you inhale by expanding your rib cage. Exhale by slowly releasing your ribs. While learning, place your palms on the sides of your chest to feel the movement and push gently inward in the last stage of the exhalation. Then hold your abdomen slightly in, rib cage stationary, and breathe in and out by allowing your shoulders to move up and down. Finally combine all three, inhaling from your abdomen, continuing with the ribs, and ending the breath with the clavicles. Exhale in the reverse order. Abdominal Lock Bend forward, rest your hands above your knees, and let the weight of your torso rest in your arms. Exhale completely through your mouth, then close your throat so no air can enter. Expand your chest, as though inhaling, and suck in your abdomen, forming a deep hollow. Try to relax the abdominal muscles as you do so. This may be difficult, but with daily practice you will soon mas",

You are here: Home Blogs When Is It Safe to Resume Exercise After Hernia Surgery? May 2, 2025 Blogs By rizerdev@rizertechnology.com Hernia surgery is often necessary to relieve discomfort and prevent serious complications. While it’s a routine procedure for many patients at Mission Surgical Clinic in Riverside, CA, the road to full recovery requires care—especially when it comes to resuming physical activity. Whether you’re a gym regular or someone who simply enjoys long walks, it’s important to understand the timing and types of exercise that are safe after hernia repair. Returning to activity too early or pushing your body too hard can increase your risk of complications, including recurrence of the hernia. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore: When you can resume exercise after hernia surgery What types of movement are safe (and which to avoid) How to gradually rebuild strength Warning signs to watch for during recovery Understanding Hernia Surgery Recovery A hernia occurs when an internal organ or tissue pushes through a weakened spot in the muscle or connective tissue. Surgical repair involves pushing the tissue back into place and reinforcing the area, often with mesh. Hernia surgeries can be open or laparoscopic : Open surgery usually requires a larger incision and longer recovery. Laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgery involves smaller incisions and often a quicker return to daily activities. However, even with laparoscopic techniques, proper healing takes time—and overexerting yourself too soon can put you at risk. General Recovery Timeline After Hernia Surgery While recovery can vary by individual, here’s a typical timeline to give you an idea of what to expect: Time Post-Surgery Activity Guidelines Day 1–3 Rest, light walking indoors, manage swelling Week 1–2 Short, gentle walks outside, avoid bending or lifting Week 3–4 Increase walking, light household chores, no strenuous activity Week 5–6 Gradual return to low-impact exercises (under medical guidance) After Week 6 Possible return to gym workouts, lifting, running, etc. (with clearance) When Can I Start Walking After Hernia Surgery? Walking is the safest and most encouraged form of activity immediately after surgery. In fact, most patients are advised to begin walking within 24 hours post-surgery. Why walking helps: Prevents blood clots Improves circulation Aids in digestion and reduces constipation Supports gentle core engagement Start with short 5–10 minute walks around your home or yard. Gradually increase your duration and distance as you feel comfortable. If you&#8217;re a Riverside local, take advantage of walking-friendly parks like Fairmount Park or the scenic trails at Mount Rubidoux once you’re ready to go outside. When Can I Resume Light Exercise? By weeks 3 to 4 , many patients can begin light exercise such as: Gentle yoga or stretching (avoiding deep core engagement) Low-resistance stationary biking Swimming (only after incisions are fully healed) Elliptical machine at low resistance Caution: Avoid exercises that involve twisting, jerking, or sudden movements. Stop immediately if you feel pain or discomfort at the incision site. When Can I Lift Weights After Hernia Surgery? Lifting too soon is one of the most common causes of hernia recurrence. General guidelines: Weeks 0–4 : Avoid all lifting heavier than 5–10 pounds Weeks 4–6 : Begin lifting light household items, like grocery bags or laundry baskets Week 6+ : Consider reintroducing weight training only with your surgeon’s approval Start with machines over free weights , as they provide more control. Focus on low weight, high repetition and avoid straining. Can I Do Core Exercises After Hernia Surgery? Core exercises need to be approached with caution , especially since hernias are most often related to weak or strained abdominal muscles. Avoid the following in the early stages of recovery: Crunches Sit-ups Planks Leg raises Heavy lifting When it&#8217;s safe (usually after week 8+): Start with gentle core engagement : Diaphragmatic breathing Pelvic tilts Supine marches Bird-dogs Dead bugs Focus on rebuilding strength, not pushing limits.

When to Safely Begin Exercise After Abdominal Surgery Exercise After Abdominal Surgery: 12 Safe, Easy Moves 6 Knowing when to start exercising after abdominal surgery is key to a good recovery. The recovery has three main phases: right after surgery, early recovery, and later recovery. Each phase has its own rules and activities. Immediate Post-Surgery Guidelines (Days 1-3) In the first days after surgery, it&#8217;s important to do gentle movements. Deep breathing exercises and leg movements are good. They help avoid blood clots and improve breathing. Take 5-10 deep breaths every hour to help expand your lungs. Perform ankle pumps by lifting your feet up and down 10-15 times every hour. Early Recovery Phase (Days 4-14) When you move into the early recovery phase, you can do more. Gentle stretching and short walks around the house are good. Always listen to your body and stop if you feel pain or discomfort. Start with short walks of 5-10 minutes, twice a day. Gently stretch your arms over your head and bend to the sides. Advanced Recovery Phase (2-6 Weeks) In the advanced recovery phase, you can do more structured exercises . Always follow what your healthcare provider or physical therapist says. These exercises help strengthen your core and improve movement. Begin with pelvic tilts to engage your core muscles. Gradually introduce more complex movements like gentle yoga ",

    "title": "Different Levels of Yoga Beginner to Advanced",
    "content": "Beginner to Advanced Yoga: Understanding the Different Levels Different Levels of Yoga Beginner to Advanced Yoga is not a competition. It is not about how quickly you can do a shoulder-stand, nor how many advanced postures you can post on social media. Yoga is a discipline, a way of life, and a journey of change that touches the body, breath, and mind. Yoga meets you where you are, but it never leaves you there. Whether you are a beginner learning to sit comfortably or an advanced yogi exploring meditation, each stage carries its own wisdom. Understanding the different levels of yoga practice—from beginner to intermediate to advanced—not only keeps you safe but also ensures steady and meaningful progress. Let us explore these stages in depth. Yoga is not a destination; it is a lifelong journey of growth, discipline, and self-discovery. Every practitioner begins at a different point, but the path naturally unfolds in stages. Just as a seed grows into a tree through nurturing, yoga progresses from the basics of body awareness to the heights of inner freedom. Levels of Yoga Students often ask: “How do I know if I am ready for the next level?” The answer is not in flexibility or strength alone, but in consistency and readiness of mind. Knowing the levels helps you: Avoid injury by building a strong foundation Move step by step instead of rushing into advanced techniques Align physical practice with yogic lifestyle Grow steadily towards mental calmness and spiritual awareness Remember: yoga is not about racing to the top; it is about deepening your practice at every stage. Level 1: Beginner Yoga – Building the Foundation Purpose of the Beginner Stage This is where the seed is planted. Beginners learn to connect body and breath, cultivate awareness, and establish the discipline of practice. Step-by-Step Beginner Sequence (20–30 minutes) Conditioning (2 minutes) – Sit quietly, close eyes, observe breath. Warm-up movements (5 minutes) – Gentle neck rotations, shoulder rolls, ankle rotations. Talasana Ekpadasana Bhujangasana Shashankasana Beginner Pranayama (5 minutes) Abdominal Breathing Sectional Breathing Beginner Meditation / Relaxation Shavasana Lifestyle for Beginners – AVAV Framework Ahaar (Diet): Begin light, reduce excess oil, sugar, and processed food. Drink warm water. Vihaar (Routine): Sleep and wake at regular times. Morning walks help. Achaar (Conduct): Practice punctuality, respect for others, non-violence in thought and action. Vichaar (Thoughts): Replace negative self-talk with affirmations like “I am improving every day.” At this stage, the goal is not perfection. Practice daily, even for 15 minutes. If you cannot sit cross-legged, use a chair. Do not push the body; let it adapt gradually. Level 2: Intermediate Yoga – Deepening the Practice Purpose of the Intermediate Stage After consistent practice (6 months to 2 years), the body feels stronger, and the mind steadier. The student now refines asanas, explores pranayama, and begins concentration practices. Step-by-Step Intermediate Sequence (40–50 minutes) Warm-up with Surya Namaskar (3–6 rounds) – Performed slowly with synchronized breathing. Trikonasana Ardha Matsyendrasana Sarvangasana Setu Bandhasana Paschimottanasana Intermediate Pranayama (10 minutes) Anulom Vilom (Alternate Nostril Breathing Bhramari Ujjayi Kriyas (Cleansing Techniques) Jal Neti Kapalabhati Intermediate Meditation Nispand Bhava Mantra Chanting Lifestyle for Intermediates – AVAV Refinement Ahaar: Shift towards sattvik food – fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds. Limit caffeine and stimulants. Vihaar: Balance work with recreation. Reduce screen time. Achaar: Practice discipline—truthfulness, contentment, self-study. Vichaar: Daily journaling, introspection, replacing gossip with meaningful conversations. This is where many lose patience, seeking novelty. Instead of chasing 50 poses, deepen awareness in a few. Hold asanas longer, focus on breath, and observe inner silence. Level 3: Advanced Yoga – Mastery and Internal Transformation Purpose of the Advanced Stage Here yoga becomes a way of life. Physical mastery is combined with mental peace and spiritual awareness. The ego dissolves, and the practitioner lives yoga off the mat. Step-by-Step Advanced Sequence (60–75 minutes) Surya Namaskar – Performed with mantra chanting and breath retention. Halasana Paryankasana Dhanurvakrasana Utkatasana Padmasana Advanced Pranayama Bhastrika Kumbhaka Advanced Meditation Mantra Japa Dhyana on Internal Light or Sound Lifestyle for Advanced – Living Yoga Ahaar: Sattvik, light, vegetarian diet. Awareness while eating. Vihaar: Balanced day with seva (service), study, practice, rest. Achaar: Complete alignment of actions with yogic principles. Vichaar: Freedom from anger, pride, jealousy. Steady compassion. Even at advanced levels, never abandon the basics. A true yogi still practices Talasana, Shavasana, and simple deep breathing. The higher you climb, the deeper your study must be.

Typically, people begin with the basics and then gradually increase their speed. Additionally, breathing coordination is essential for effective yoga practices. There are a few yogic styles, like Hatha Yoga, which has a slow pace but is very effective for beginners in the Yoga field. Once you feel confident in the postures and long-term pose handling, then you can try other yoga styles. The different yoga styles in India evolved with time, and we can&rsquo;t confirm this by sitting by the side pool. In the article, there is guidance for Yoga and its types to perform as a beginner. Hatha Yoga Guide for Beginners Hatha Yoga is basically best physical yoga styles. Like, if yoga had a family tree, Hatha yoga would be sitting right at the roots; it is an ancient form of yoga. &ldquo;Hatha&rdquo; itself is defined with two words, &ldquo;Ha&rdquo; (sun) and &ldquo;Tha&rdquo; (moon), which sounds poetic but really just means it&rsquo;s all about balance lille yin and yang in Chinese philosophy. You won&rsquo;t find any frantic, sweat-fest flows here. Hatha&rsquo;s the chill one in the yoga crew. You get to actually hang out in each pose, figure out what your limbs are doing, and, honestly, maybe even remember to breathe (wild concept, right?). Posture? Gets better. Body awareness? Skyrockets. And your mind might finally stop running a million miles a minute. Maybe. Before any fast-paced practice, it is one of the best yogic styles. Have some relaxing yoga poses and breathing techniques. Better for the breath coordination. Builds a strong foundation and improves the cycles of the body. Is Vinyasa Yoga Good for Beginners? This is one of the fast-paced movements in Yoga, and generally not for beginners. Each movement of this yogic style is guided and known as the flowing style of Yoga. It is like a dance guide and a continuous movement of the postures. There are chances of getting injured while moving in such a fast-paced yoga without any previous experience. In Vinyasa meaning every posture is connected smoothly with the breathing of the person performing yoga. It is not recommended for beginners. Best for the intensity practice. Give a breath coordination or go with the air flow in and out of the body. What is Yin Yoga? Yin Yoga For Beginners Yin Yoga&rsquo;s basically the chillest yoga you&rsquo;ll ever meet. Forget racing through sweaty vinyasas&mdash;this style is all about hitting pause. You drop into a pose, and then&hellip; You just hang out. We&rsquo;re talking two, three, maybe even five minutes. Sometimes longer, if you&rsquo;re feeling wild. The magic? It&rsquo;s not about flexing your biceps or chasing six-pack abs. Yin is after the deep stuff&mdash;ligaments, tendons, that webby fascia holding you together. No forcing, no straining. You just kind of melt, let gravity do its thing, and before you know it, your body opens up in ways you didn&rsquo;t even know you needed. It&rsquo;s like getting a massage without the awkward small talk. Best for the daily stretching practices. Good for the people who want to stay in a pose for a long time. Long holding poses like Butterfly Pose (Baddha Konasana) , Dragon Pose (Low Lunge), Caterpillar Pose (Seated Forward Fold), Sphinx Pose (Gentle Backbend), and Reclined Twist are practised in this style of Yoga. Gives an emotional balance to the body and balances the nervous system. Restorative Yoga Pose Exercise for Beginners Restorative Yoga is basically a blanket fort of the yoga world. Forget all that sweaty stretch",

I love yoga but am advised that I should longer do inversions due to the pressure on my eyes, as I am at elevated risk for glaucoma. (There are a lot of yoga inversions in standard asana practice, including Standing Forward Bend Pose (Uttanasana) and Downward Facing Dog Pose (Adho Mukha Svanasana).) “Inspired by one of my favorite yoga teachers who had a neck issue that forced her to change her lifelong practice when she was my age, I am going to look at this as an opportunity to practice my yoga, e.g., deal with this “bump in the road” with acceptance, adjustment, and equanimity.” —Sally This week I saw the above posted on Facebook by a friend who is a reader of this blog. I commented that her approach to this news seemed like a good one. Of course, I believe that accepting change rather than fighting with reality is always a good place to start. But I also had lots of ideas for how she could adapt her poses and her practice to keep her eyes safe. So I told her that, and she was enthusiastic to hear my ideas. Inversions Are Not for Everybody Rather than letting her know privately, I decided to write a post about it. After all, even though yoga inversions can be wonderful additions to your practice because they can be very calming, there are also certain health conditions for which they are contraindicated. In addition to glaucoma, these include uncontrolled high blood pressure, detached retina, and recent oral surgery. If you’re suffering from GERD (acid reflux), it seems like a good idea to avoid long-held inversions as well. So I thought there are probably quite a few of you out there who have been told you should no longer do inversions and that you, too, would like to see this information. What is a Yoga Inversion? First, let’s look at what counts as an “inversion” in yoga because these are all going to be poses that you should either modify or avoid. In yoga, any pose where your head is below your heart is an “inversion.” This includes full inversions, such as Headstand (Sirsasana), Shoulderstand (Sarvangasana), and Legs-Up-the-Wall Pose (Viparita Karani), where your legs are higher than your heart and your heart is higher than your head. This also includes partial inversions, where your legs are below your heart (typically because you’re standing on your feet), but your heart is above your head, such as Standing Forward Bend Pose and Downward-Facing Dog Pose. I’m going to include some backbends where your head is dropped back in this category, too, because your head is below your heart in these poses as well. You will need to avoid both partial and full inversions because they all put pressure on your head and can raise your blood pressure. Fortunately, there are ways to modify many of these poses. And for those you can’t modify, there are some very good alternatives! 8 Ways to Modify Yoga Inversions Partial Inversions 1. Downward Facing Dog Pose (Adho Mukha Svanasana) & Standing Forward Bend Pose (Uttanasana) : Practice Half Downward Facing Dog Pose at the wall or with hands on a table or the back of a chair. Keep your spine elongated and parallel with the floor, and keep your head between your arms and in line with your spine. This pose can be a great alternative to either Downward Facing Dog Pose or Standing Forward Bend Pose. 2. How to Modify Wide-Legged Standing Forward Bend Pose (Prasarita Padottanasana) : Practice Half Standing Forward Bend pose with hands on the wall or on a table, or on the back of a chair. Keep your head between your arms and in line with your spine. Or place your hands on blocks high enough so you can keep your spine elongated and parallel with the floor, as shown here: If you want to support your head the way you do in the classic pose, you can rest your forearms on a tabletop and rest your head on top of them like this: 3. Pyramid Pose (Parsvottanasana) : Practice Half Pyramid Pose with hands on the wall or on a table, or on the back of a chair. Keep your spine elongated and parallel with the floor, and keep your head between your arms and in line with your spine. 4. Bridge Pose (Setu Bandha Sarvangasana) : The only way to modify this would be to remove the backbend and to lie in Constructive Rest pose. This is what I’d do if I was in a class ",
