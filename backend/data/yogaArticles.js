    title: 'Introduction to Yoga: What is Yoga?',
    category: 'introduction',
    content: `Yoga is an ancient practice that originated in India over 5,000 years ago. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj," which means "to join" or "to unite." Yoga is not just physical exercise; it's a holistic practice that combines physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation, and ethical principles.

Yoga helps to unite the body, mind, and spirit, promoting overall well-being and inner peace. Modern yoga practice focuses primarily on asanas (physical postures) and pranayama (breathing exercises), which help improve flexibility, strength, balance, and mental clarity.

Regular yoga practice can lead to numerous benefits including reduced stress, improved sleep, enhanced flexibility and strength, better posture, and increased mindfulness.`

    title: 'Advanced Poses: When Are You Ready?',
    category: 'advanced',
    content: `Advanced yoga poses require significant strength, flexibility, balance, and body awareness. Here's how to know if you're ready.

Signs You Might Be Ready:
- Consistent practice for 2+ years
- Strong foundational alignment
- Good body awareness
- No injuries or chronic pain
- Ability to modify and use props intelligently
- Understanding of proper warm-up
- Patient, non-competitive attitude

Examples of Advanced Poses:
- Arm balances (crow, side crow, handstand)
- Deep backbends (full wheel, king pigeon)
- Inversions (headstand, handstand, forearm stand)
- Advanced binds and twists
- Deep hip openers (splits, pigeon variations)

Preparation Requirements:
- Strong core muscles
- Flexible hamstrings and hips
- Good shoulder mobility
- Wrist strength (for arm balances)
- Balance and proprioception
- Patience and persistence

Important Considerations:
- Advanced doesn't mean "better"
- Foundation is everything - don't skip basics
- Progress is not linear
- Some poses may never be accessible (and that's okay)
- Injury prevention is more important than achievement
- Work with experienced teachers

Risks of Rushing:
- Serious injury (wrist, shoulder, back, neck)
- Reinforcing poor alignment
- Developing ego attachment to poses
- Burnout and frustration

Remember: Yoga is about the journey, not the destination. Advanced poses are tools for exploration, not goals to achieve.`

    title: 'Yoga After Surgery: Recovery Guidelines',
    category: 'safety',
    content: `Returning to yoga after surgery requires patience, caution, and medical clearance. Each surgery type has different considerations.

General Guidelines:
- Always get clearance from your surgeon before returning
- Start very slowly and gently
- Listen to your body - pain is a warning sign
- Use props liberally for support
- Focus on gentle, restorative practices initially
- Avoid any poses that stress the surgical area

Abdominal Surgery:
- Avoid core work and twists initially
- Avoid poses that compress abdomen
- Focus on gentle stretching and breathing
- Wait for complete healing (often 6-8 weeks minimum)
- Gradually reintroduce poses

Back Surgery:
- Extremely cautious approach needed
- Avoid forward folds, backbends, and twists initially
- Focus on gentle movements and walking
- Work with a physical therapist
- Very gradual reintroduction over months

Knee Surgery:
- Avoid weight-bearing on affected leg initially
- Focus on upper body and seated poses
- Gentle range of motion exercises as approved
- Use props and support
- Avoid deep lunges and squats

Shoulder Surgery:
- Avoid weight-bearing on arms
- Avoid overhead movements
- Focus on lower body and restorative poses
- Gentle range of motion as approved by PT

Timeline Considerations:
- First 2 weeks: Rest and gentle movement only
- 2-6 weeks: Very gentle, modified practice with clearance
- 6-12 weeks: Gradual reintroduction of poses
- 3+ months: Continue modifications as needed

Always work closely with your healthcare team, including physical therapists and certified yoga therapists familiar with post-surgical recovery.`

    title: 'Yoga Philosophy: The Eight Limbs of Yoga',
    category: 'philosophy',
    content: `Classical yoga, as outlined by Patanjali in the Yoga Sutras, consists of eight limbs (Ashtanga) that guide practitioners toward enlightenment and self-realization.

The Eight Limbs:

1. Yama (Ethical Restraints):
   - Ahimsa (non-violence)
   - Satya (truthfulness)
   - Asteya (non-stealing)
   - Brahmacharya (moderation)
   - Aparigraha (non-possessiveness)

2. Niyama (Personal Observances):
   - Saucha (cleanliness)
   - Santosha (contentment)
   - Tapas (discipline)
   - Svadhyaya (self-study)
   - Ishvara Pranidhana (surrender)

3. Asana (Physical Postures):
   - Steady and comfortable poses
   - Prepare body for meditation
   - Modern yoga focuses heavily on this limb

4. Pranayama (Breath Control):
   - Regulation of life force through breathing
   - Calms the mind
   - Prepares for meditation

5. Pratyahara (Withdrawal of Senses):
   - Turning attention inward
   - Reducing external distractions
   - Bridge between external and internal practices

6. Dharana (Concentration):
   - Focused attention on single point
   - Training the mind to concentrate
   - Foundation for meditation

7. Dhyana (Meditation):
   - Sustained concentration
   - Uninterrupted flow of awareness
   - Deep state of absorption

8. Samadhi (Enlightenment):
   - Union with the divine
   - Transcendence of self
   - Ultimate goal of yoga practice

Modern Practice:
While modern yoga emphasizes asana and pranayama, understanding all eight limbs provides a complete path. The physical practice is just one aspect of a holistic journey toward self-realization and inner peace.`

    title: 'Common Yoga Injuries and Prevention',
    category: 'safety',
    content: `While yoga is generally safe, injuries can occur, especially when practicing without proper guidance or pushing beyond limits.

Common Injuries:
1. Wrist Strain:
   - From weight-bearing poses (downward dog, arm balances)
   - Prevention: Proper alignment, strengthen wrists, use props

2. Lower Back Pain:
   - From rounding in forward folds, over-arching in backbends
   - Prevention: Focus on alignment, engage core, modify poses

3. Hamstring Strains:
   - From pushing too hard in forward folds
   - Prevention: Warm up, use props, respect limits

4. Shoulder Issues:
   - From improper alignment in poses, overuse
   - Prevention: Strengthen supporting muscles, proper alignment

5. Knee Injuries:
   - From misalignment in standing poses, forcing lotus
   - Prevention: Align knees properly, use props, avoid forcing

Prevention Strategies:
- Always warm up before practice
- Focus on alignment over depth
- Use props when needed
- Listen to your body - pain is a warning
- Work with qualified instructors
- Progress gradually
- Rest when needed
- Cross-train to avoid overuse

If You're Injured:
- Stop the pose immediately
- Apply ice if acute injury
- Rest and allow healing
- Consult healthcare provider
- Work with yoga therapist for modifications
- Don't push through pain

Remember: Yoga should feel challenging but not painful. Discomfort in stretching is normal; sharp or shooting pain is not.`

    title: 'Yoga and Meditation: Integrating Mindful Practice',
    category: 'meditation',
    content: `Yoga and meditation are deeply interconnected practices that complement each other beautifully. Asana prepares the body for meditation, while meditation deepens the yoga experience.

Why Combine Them:
- Asana releases physical tension that distracts from meditation
- Physical practice builds body awareness useful in meditation
- Meditation enhances mindfulness during asana practice
- Together they create holistic mind-body-spirit integration

Simple Meditation Techniques:

1. Breath Awareness:
   - Sit comfortably with straight spine
   - Focus on natural breath
   - When mind wanders, return to breath
   - Start with 5-10 minutes

2. Body Scan:
   - Lie in Savasana or sit comfortably
   - Bring attention to each body part systematically
   - Notice sensations without judgment
   - Release tension as you go

3. Loving-Kindness (Metta):
   - Send well-wishes to yourself
   - Extend to loved ones, then all beings
   - Cultivates compassion

4. Mantra Meditation:
   - Repeat a word or phrase
   - "Om," "Peace," or personal mantra
   - Focus anchors the mind

Integrating into Practice:
- Begin practice with 2-5 minutes of meditation
- End practice with 5-15 minutes of Savasana
- Practice mindful movement (awareness during asana)
- Use transitions as meditation opportunities
- Practice seated meditation separately

Benefits:
- Reduces stress and anxiety
- Improves focus and concentration
- Enhances self-awareness
- Promotes emotional regulation
- Deepens spiritual connection
- Improves overall well-being

Start with just a few minutes daily and build gradually. Consistency is more important than duration.`
